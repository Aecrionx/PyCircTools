## Installing PyCircTools and importing it.

To install PyCircTools, use pip by calling the following command:

```
pip install PyCircTools
```
Importing it is as easy as it gets, just insert the line 
```
from PyCircTools.*subpackage* import *modules*
``` 
at the start of your code, and substitute subpackage with the package you want, and modules with the modules you want to import to your project.
